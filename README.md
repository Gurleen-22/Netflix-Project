Tools & Libraries

The analysis revealed that Netflix features significantly more movies than TV shows. Through visual exploration and querying, various interesting insights were discoveredâ€”such as identifying the most frequent movie genre on the platform and analyzing which genres received the highest average votes. Additionally, the project explored which movie had the highest popularity, its corresponding genre, and which year saw the highest number of films added. These insights were supported through well-structured data visualizations and real-world questioning.
